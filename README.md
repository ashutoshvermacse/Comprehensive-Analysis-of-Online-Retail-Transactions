# Comprehensive Analysis of Online Retail Transactions

This project analyzes a transactional dataset containing all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retailer. The data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail

The following analyses have been performed:

1. RFM Analysis: Conducted RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This helps in understanding customer value and targeting marketing efforts effectively.

2. Customer Segmentation: Applied k-means clustering to group customers based on their RFM scores and other relevant features. This segmentation aids in identifying different customer personas for personalized marketing strategies.

3. Sales Performance Analysis: Analyzed sales performance to identify best-selling products and categories. This insight helps in inventory management and optimizing the product catalog.

4. Churn Analysis: Calculated the churn rate by identifying customers who have stopped purchasing over a specific period. This analysis assists in developing retention strategies to reduce customer churn.

5. Market Basket Analysis: Performed market basket analysis to identify products that are frequently purchased together. This analysis is useful for cross-selling and up-selling strategies.

This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product associations, aiding in strategic decision-making for the online retailer.
